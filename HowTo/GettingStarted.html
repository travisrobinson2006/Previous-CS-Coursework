    <p class="seventy-five-percent">So, getting things set up is by far the hardest part of this whole process.  There are a lot of things that need to be done, and it took me quite a while just trying to get it all sorted out. So you, dear reader, get to benefit from my wisdom as we go through this first step.</p>
    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">The first thing that needs to be done is to become a Facebook developer. This is required in order for you to receive an API key, to tell Facebook where you'll be connecting from, and to access the Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Graph API Documentation</a> To become a Facebook developer, go to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">https://developers.facebook.com</a> where you will be given a series of instructions and validation tests to ensure you're a person.</p>

    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        From there, you want to go to "My Apps" located at the top of the screen, and "Add a New App".
    </p>
    
    <center><img src="GoToMyApps.png" alt="To to My Apps"></center>
    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        This will bring up a pop-up window giving various selections of new app types, ranging from Android to Website. We want to use Website. You'll be asked to name the app and to select the category of app; I named mine TestApp and the category is education.
    </p>
    
    <center><img src="SelectAppType.png" alt="Select Your App Type"></center>
    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        At this point, if you click "Skip Quick Start" in the top right corner, you should find yourself at the app's dashboard. Here you'll the find App ID (this is your API key, though nowhere in the documentation does it tell you that) API Version (more relevant for real app development, we only use it in one place, mentioned below), and App Secret. From here you want to go to Settings, on the left hand side.
    </p>

        <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        Next, you want to enter the site URL. Start by hitting the Add Platform button, then click the appropriate platform, which for what we will be doing will be 'Website.'
    </p>
    
    <center><img src="AssignURL.png" alt="Click Add Platform"></center>    
    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        Here you want to enter the site URL that you'll be using the Facebook API from. If you don't put in the URL, or if you don't put in the correct one, you won't be able to access the API functions, so this is important that you have it.
    </p>
    
    <center><img src="AssignURL.png" alt="Click Add Platform"></center>
    
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        The last thing you need to do is get the user logged in to Facebook. Facebook has written a pretty decent guide on this part, and since it's not part of the Graph API, I'm just going to point you to what they have, over at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web</a> where for our purposes of learning how to get started with the Graph API, you just need to copy and paste the provided code, substituting in the App ID (aka your API key) and the version number (provided at the dashboard, and as of this writing was version 2.5)
    </p>
        
    <p class="seventy-five-percent">
        Now that we're up and running, you have your API key, and you're logged in to Facebook, we can start making API calls. From here on it's incredibly easy. It all comes done to one function call, but that one function call gives you access to the entirety of the Facebook Graph API. Within that function lies all the magic. So what's the magic call? FB.api() And how do we access that magic? With the functions four parameters: path, method, params, and callback. There's a lot you can do with all of these, and in each of these we're going to discuss what you can do with it and give an example of its use. Personally, I recommend starting with the path parameter and then building from there, as that's how I've layed out the how-to, but you can check them out however you wish. Just click a link at the top of the page, and it'll take to the parameter you want!
